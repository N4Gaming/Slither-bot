# Slither-bot
**Note:
Project "temporarily" discontinued as the original authors have lost interest in the game/project however continued development from fellow developers is not to be discouraged, if you wish so. An improved version of this bot (improved fork) is and can be found here but both have been discontinued.

One of the main reasons for discontinuation, is to embark on a new journey working on other areas in programming and using other languages as there is always something new to learn.

New active project will be linked soon and ANYBODY is welcome to collaborate with us! Await new updates!

Slither.io bot
Just for fun and AI. Written in Javascript, this is a project which the aim is to make a computer play against humans inside a human-driven game, which is in this case Slither.io. The goal is simple - try and make the snake live and get as long as possible.
